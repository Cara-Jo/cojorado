Girl Develop It is now in over [45 cities across the country](http://girldevelopit.com/chapters). It's pretty simple to see why; we offer affordable opportunities for women to learn software development. In nearly 5 years Girl Develop It has grown to nearly 30,000 members across the country and empowers over 1,000 women a month.

Why is Girl Develop It so important? Women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but hold just 25% of the jobs in technical or computing fields. I personally don't like those numbers, and I'm not alone.

That's why I started a local chapter here in Boulder, Colorado. I wanted to help diversify this heavily white male scene. Seriously it's like every developer here is a white male, it's actually impressive the lack of diversity. 

When I landed in Boulder in early 2013 the first thing I did was explore the idea of starting a Girl Develop It out here. I had helped start one in Detroit and saw it's success there and wanted to spread that across the country.

## Local Success
In the one year and a half that Girl Develop It Boulder has been around we've achieved a lot. 

**We have grown to 880 members**

**We've built up a community through our free social events**

**Boulder wasn't enough - so we expanded to Denver and Fort Collins too**

## The future 
As the group grows, so do the needs of its members. We want to make sure that everyone has access to the tools they need to feel empowered. 

#### New classes
Our classes are designed to break down what can seem like a daunting topic - to it's fundamentals. Classes are typically 8 hours and are taught over a weekend. 

To start we want to offer some new classes like Python, Ruby, Android, iOs, Java, UX, and more. 

#### New Workshops
Workshops are a great opportunity for our members to get their hands dirty with a new topic without committing to a whole class. These topics are usually taught in 2-3 hours on a weekday. We want to offer a huge (seriously huge) range of new workshops this year. 

Just to start we're going to offer workshops like Sketch 3, Photoshop, Agile/Scrum, Behavioral Science, WordPress, FTP & GitHub Pages, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS, Sublime, Command Line, Docker and more.

#### Women in Tech panel series
We're putting together a 6 week Women in Tech panel series for the spring. We will be bringing together some of the most amazing Women in the Boulder/Denver tech scene to inspire our members.

#### More community events
Happy Hour, Code & Coffee, Hack nights, and other social events really help our members connect with one another and create lasting relationships. 

#### Teacher Training
Coming this year! GDI will offer teacher training so you get the skills you need to be a successful instructor.

## We Need You
You don't have to be a woman to help. You don't have to be a rockstar developer. You don't have to jump right in. 

## There are many ways to help

#### Instruct
Co-Teach or run solo, for a class and/or workshop!

#### Teacher Assist
Answer student questions and provide added insight.

#### Develop Curriculum
If you have something you want to teach, there's probably people who want to learn it.
Review/enhance existing curriculum or create new.

#### Organizational Needs
Help out with marketing, social media, class scheduling, work with sponsors, answer student questions, & more

#### Provide Space
Show off your awesome workspace by hosting a workshop, happy hour, or class.

#### Donate Time
Have a crew of developers? Have your team TA or even teach a class for GDI.

#### Donate Resources
Food, Drinks, Supplies, & swag all help make the learning experience better.

> As the Lead Designer at Simple Energy, I've had a chance to design some really awesome things, for a great company. I've been there from what feels like the beginning, starting with the company when it was only 12 people strong. 

> I've watched it grow into a large company of 50+ in less than two years, and with that bringing in some great talent and ideas. 

> Design isn't all I do at Simple Energy. I am on the engineering team, so I'm immersed deep within the produciton of our amazing products. But, that doesn't mean I just sit in a cave all day and write code. I get to help design the office, the custom Simple Energy beer labels, the team member swag, annual holiday cards, and other goodies that make working there just more fun.

> Below are a few of my favorite projects I've worked at while at Simple Energy.

## Logo Design
> Our old logo with Museo Sans and gradients everywhere was looking a little dates. I collaborated with a team of brand specialists to work on re-branding the company.

## Business Cards
> Our brand is simple, clean, fun, and flat. When designing these business cards I wanted to bring all those elements into a 3.5" x 2" space. The leadership and sales teams all received horizontal cards, while the engineers and designers received vertical cards. But of course everyone had an option of what format they wanted!

## Corporate Website
> With our re-brand came a shiny new site to showcase our Engagement Platform and other products. In addition to showcasing our beautiful products, this site also reflects the great [culture at Simple Energy](http://simpleenergy.com/company/).

## 2014 Holiday Cards
> To keep up with Simple Energy's mission of motivating people to save energy, we decided to be a little witty with this year's holiday cards.

## Beer Labels
> Simple Energy has a brewmaster on staff, he uses his skills to create custom beer for the company. The team votes on names for each new batch, then it's labeled and bottled for everyone to take home.

## Core Values Icons
> At Simple Energy we have a set of Core Values that everyone is expected to uphold. To keep those Values front and center in the culture, we were tasked with designing icons to represent them that could be used throughout the office. I collaborated with another designer to create these five. Of course Do The Hard Things and Have Fun Together are my favorite, but I'm a bit biased.

## Ragnar Relay Apparel
> The team members at Simple Energy are very active, and sometimes participate in crazy races together. As team captain of our company Ragnar Relay team the Rolling Blackouts, I got to design super custom race shirts. The team wore these throughout the weekend to represent the team and the company.

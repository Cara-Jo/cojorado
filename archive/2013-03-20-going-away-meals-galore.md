As it turns out, when you're moving to another state, everyone wants to take you out for a meal! 

I swear, I gained 10 pounds just in my last week in Michigan. Good thing I'm heading to Colorado, where everyone works out all the time. 

First it was breakfast with Alan at the oh-so-delicious Hudson Cafe...

Then, it was margaritas and tacos with my favorite Humans from Are You a Human.

Closed out by sliders with the Refresh Detroit friends.

Much love!

In a few short weeks I’m moving to Colorado. Its kind of out of the blue, because I’m in a relationship with Detroit. However, I’ve been cheating on it with the mountains and blue skies for a while now. I’ve always wanted to live out west. The blue skies, snow capped peaks, active lifestyle and awesome weather has always been attractive to me.  Detroit is attractive too, if you like grey skys, high winds, humidity and grumpy people. Despite all that I’ve fallen in love with the grit of Detroit, because it’s resilient. In Detroit you make a difference no matter what you’re doing, and every one knows you.  It’s a big city, with a small town feel, and that’s sexy. 

Except last September I changed my view on things when I visited Lake Tahoe. Upon seeing those beautiful mountains I exclaimed “Holy shit, I need to live here.”. “Here” was figurative. “Here” was somewhere that had mountains, sunshine, and of course a decent paying job. The job only really had to pay for a place to live, running shoes, food and bike repairs. 

I’ve had this little piece of paper that has moved with me to two apartments and two jobs that is a simple drawing of a house in the mountains with a little heart. I kept looking at it and going “someday”, but never really knowing when that was going to be. 

A friend of mine recently passed along my resume to a friend of his in Boulder. That friend passed it along to his colleagues and so on. That gesture got me an interview and a job offer (which I accepted) at startup in Boulder.  

Boulder seems like the type of city that I could thrive in. Biking, running, hiking, sunny skies, beer, good food, awesome community, and an epic startup scene. I’m kind of addicted to all those things.

*(Plus, I get to hike in the mountains. THE MOUNTAINS!!)*

The only thing they’re missing is a Girl Develop It. But don’t worry, I’ll start one of those when I get there.

I’m going to use this blog, journal, site, whatever to document my journey from Detroit to Boulder and all things Colorado related. The name comes from my nick name “Cojo” and a play on “Colorado”.

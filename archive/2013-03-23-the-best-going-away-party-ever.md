Last night we had one hell of a party! I had an open invite for people to show up at 8pm at Buffalo Wild Wings and you guys did not disappoint! I showed up early, and some of you were even tailgating before I got there! 

I don’t even LIKE BW3! I just knew it would be a good spot to have a large group of people, and they have tall Colorado beer on tap. Plus the waiter, Mike G., was freaking amazing. He was on his A game last night and even got emotional because I was leaving. I love you Mike G.

For the past 28 years I’ve lived in Michigan. It doesn’t seem like that long in the span of a lifetime, but that’s my entire life thus far! I want to see other states.

Don’t get me wrong, Michigan is probably one of the coolest states I’ve ever been to. Although, I’ve only been to 20 states so don’t take my opinion too seriously. But my opinion on the things I’m going to miss should be taken seriously, because I’m seriously going to miss them. 

Here’s my top 5.

**5. Mejier**

I have so many memories about Meijer. Meijer is the best 24 hour grocery store ever. Ever. I remember going there in high school and seeing how long we could stay until they asked us to leave. We’d go with a group and split into two teams and fill a shopping cart with random things, swap carts and see how long it would take the other team to put the stuff away.

I mean, where else can you drink cardboard beer and get stuck in tiny chairs?

### 4. Using my hand as a map

Michigan is awesome because it’s shaped like a Mitten, and that means you can use your hand as a map! People in other states are so jealous! How will I show where I’m from now? P.S. I totally stole that logo from [High Five Threads](http://highfivethreads.com).

### 3. The Mackinac Bridge 

This is by far one of my favorite things about driving up north. The Mackinac bridge is a 5 mile long suspension bridge that connects the lower and upper peninsulas of Michigan. Growing up in the lower peninsula and going to college in the upper peninsula  I’ve become quite intimate with this bridge. 

Every Labor Day they open it up to pedestrians and it’s the only time during the year you can walk across it with 50,000+ people. They also have a lottery for runners to run across the bridge to begin the Labor Day walk. In 2012 I had the awesome honor of doing that, one of my favorite bridge memories. 

Before that, my favorite memory was when I was 5 and my family was driving back from the U.P. and I saw a guy who looked like Santa driving a red truck. He had the plate “Santa” and I was convinced he was real.

### 2. The Lakes

Ohhhh the lakes! Michigan is the Great Lakes state for a reason, it has all these big ass lakes surrounding it! There’s also a ton of inland lakes too, where I spent too many summer days to count. I will miss always being a 20 minute drive from a fresh lake and a swim.

### 1. My mom

My mom lives in Traverse City, a quick four hour drive from Detroit. But now she’ll be 1,200+ miles away and a five hour plane ride. Thats okay though, she’s happy for me and doesn’t want me to stay in Detroit if I’d rather be in the mountains. I’ll miss our summer bike rides, shopping at the farmer’s markets, her cheering me on at races, and our daily phone calls. Although the phone calls won’t stop, they’ll just be a two hour difference. She’s awesome, you should be jealous she’s my mom.

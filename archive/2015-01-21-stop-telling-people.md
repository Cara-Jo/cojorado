One year and nine months ago, give or take a few days, I moved to Boulder, Colorado. I never thought I would move to Colorado, hell it wasn't even on my radar. 

About six months before moving to Colorado, in September 2012, I visited my dear friend in Lake Tahoe. At this point in my life, the largest mountain I had ever seen, was Camelback Mountain in Phoenix, Arizona. Camelback Mountain was the coolest thing, at that moment, that I had ever seen. Period. 

Let's just say that Lake Tahoe blew my brain. I was living in Detroit, Michigan at the time so mountains were the sweetest thing ever. Seriously, have you seen them? I made it my mission to live in the mountains at some point in my life. 

In the meantime I was happy at my job, I had a great boyfriend, my sweet penthouse apartment was the envy of many, and I was doing great stuff in an even greater city. I was pretty content with waiting to live in the mountains.

Fast forward to March 2013. My boyfriend of two years told me that he didn't really want to be in a relationship with me, but still wanted to live with me in our swanky apartment. I wanted cheap rent and didn't want to move, so I stuck it out. I was really involved in the Detroit tech & design community, and Detroit, in general. I often went out to the bars with my group of bike nerds (the cruiser kind, not the leather kind) and made a lot of friends. 

One night, after getting fed up with my situation at home, I went out with one of my friends for some drinks and a good rant. He had just gotten back from a trip out west, one of his destinations was Boulder. He raved about it and said that it's the kind of place I would love to live. I just blurted out "Oh my god I know, I want to live there it looks so cool!". I had literally read about Boulder in a forward to a book about a startup. That was the extent of my Boulder knowledge. 

He responded with:

**_"Do you really think you're good enough to get a job in Boulder?"_**

What? 

That comment stuck with me. I've had people telling me that I can't do things all my life. 

_"You can't get a job as a developer, that's for guys."_

_"You can't make money with an art degree -- you're just going to work at McDonalds."_

_"You can't run a marathon, that's only for really good athletes."_

_"You can't change the dynamic of the tech world, it's always going to be white males."_

Etc. Etc.

Not to say all my male friends were as negative as him.  I have some good ones, like the one who let me rant about what Mr. Negative said. He said to me "hey, give me your resume, I bet you can get a job in Boulder.". He was originally just going to proofread it to make sure I hadn't misspelled all the worlds. He passed on my resume to a very awesome man by the name of David Cohen, who then passed it along to the equally awesome startup CEOs in Boulder. 

Two weeks later, I moved to Boulder. I said, "Hey boyfriend (I think that's what he was called), I'm moving to Boulder." Because let's be honest; when your boyfriend of two years just doesn't want to be with you anymore -- that kind of makes you want to do your own thing.

Suffice to say, if that man didn't tell me "you're not good enough" I probably would have never tried to move to Boulder. Thank you ex-friend for pushing me to do something I didn't think I could do. 

Now that I think about it, whenever someone has said "you can't do that" to me, it's just motivated me to prove them wrong. 

I did get a job as a developer & designer, that makes money - despite my art degree.

I did run a marathon. It was slow because I was recovering from an unrelated injury, but I did it. And I'm going to do it again, and again.

Right now in Boulder, the dynamic is changing for women in tech. Not just because of me, but because of people like me who are all working together towards the same goal. I know I can't do it alone, and that's okay.

**The next time you tell someone they can't do something, be prepared to be proven wrong.**

Cara Jo is the Senior Designer for the training team at DataStax, a Santa Clara, California-based company that provides the enterprise solution for Apache Cassandra.

Soon after, she built her first website to show off her Pokemon drawings after learning HTML & CSS. After building sites for her friends and family throughout Junior & High school she went to college at Northern Michigan University. While at NMU she dabbled in a few majors and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts with an emphasis on photography & web design.

After graduating from NMU Cara Jo moved to downtown Detroit, Michigan where she worked as the Senior Designer for the Detroit Media Partnership as well as Are You a Human.

<p>Or, one van full of Ragnar Runners! </p>

<p>A Ragnar Relay is one of those things that you tell your mom you’re going to do and she either responds with “You’re crazy” or tries to join in. In my case, it was the latter, but there are a lot of people out there who think doing a 200 mile relay over 36 hours with 11 of your friends is…crazy. </p>

<p>Now that I think about it, Ragnar <strong>IS</strong> crazy. </p>

<h3 id="crazy-fun">Crazy fun</h3>
<p>Here’s the thing; Ragnar is fun if you embrace the crazy. You have to go into it with a positive attitude and try not to let the little things get to you. Only then will you be able to experience the joy and achievement of running 200 miles as a team spread between two vans.</p>

<p>For the 2014 Colorado race, I gathered a handful of my crazy runner co-workers and convinced a few friends to join in on this adventure from Copper Mountain to Aspen. </p>

<p>Before you even get to run, there’s some things that need to be taken care of as a team. First - the team name. We had to come up with the best team name that represented the people on it. After many submissions to one of my many Google Forms, we settled on “Rolling Blackouts”. We landed on this because it’s a witty play on energy usage, and we have a custom beer in its namesake. </p>

<p>Not to mention there’s the notebooks, gear lists, food lists, van logistics, and money.  </p>

<p><img src="/images/articles/ragnar-van.jpg" alt="Rolling Blackouts Van" /></p>

<p>Second - getting everyone in one spot at the same time for the pre-race dinner &amp; van decorating. One of our team members has a cabin in Silverthorn, which is not far from the start. He let the team take it over for the night and we all made dinner together before giggling ourselves to sleep at something like 9pm. </p>

<p>Alarms are set for 4:45am, so that Van 1 could get on the road to the start. Someone on our team’s has their alarm tone set to the theme song from the Lego Movie, so at 4:45am we all awoke to <strong><em>“EVERYTHING IS AWESOME - EVERYTHING IS COOL WHEN YOU’RE PART OF A TEAM”</em></strong>. Not going to lie, it was a pretty hilarious start to the day.</p>

<p>Van 1 gets rolling bright and early and heads to the start. Van 2 however…goes back to sleep. We’re not scheduled to start for another 7 hours, and plan to take full advantage of sleeping in a bed. It did give us time to head to the grocery store to grab some last minute snacks that Van 1 needed, and to get fixings for breakfast. </p>

<p>We meet Van 1 at Exchange 6 and start running legs 7-12. We won’t see Van 2 again for another 8 or so hours. They take advantage of the free time and go out to eat and sleep. </p>

<p>This piggybacking continues for the duration of the event until we finally all meet up at the finish line to cheer on runner 12 as she completes leg 36 into the finish. </p>

<h3 id="crazy-hard">Crazy Hard</h3>
<p>A lot of people think that <strong>running</strong> Ragnar is hard. I think it’s actually the parts where you’re <strong>not</strong> running that’s harder. </p>

<p>There are times you want to straight up kick people out of your van, or just want everyone to shut up so you can get 30 seconds of sleep. </p>

<p>You’re sleeping on the floor of an elementary school gym thinking to yourself “Gosh it smells like shit in here, why am I doing this?”. Or the person next to you won’t stop snoring/farting/talking. 
<img src="/images/articles/ragnar-sleepingfloor.jpg" alt="Sleeping on the floor with style" /></p>

<p>The things you put into your stomach are ridiculous. I ate more random crap during the Relay then I do on a drunken Christmas treat binge. We had one member of our team bring home-made fried rice, and that was about the sanest thing I ate the whole trip. I mean I was sitting in the front of the van giving directions elbow deep into a bag of Cheetos. I didn’t even recognize myself. </p>

<p><img src="/images/articles/ragnar-friedrice.jpg" alt="Fried Rice" /></p>

<p>Then there’s the running. The race is actually quite hard, Ragnar even says that it’s one of their hardest races in the series. The Colorado Relay is the highest in terms of elevation, and running that high in the sky is hard. Running and then stopping and then running again is harder than people think. Your leg muscles start to lock up after your 8 mile run when you’re crammed into a car chasing down your runner. </p>

<h3 id="crazy-exhausting--emotional">Crazy exhausting &amp; emotional</h3>

<p>You’re sleeping on the floor with your slowly deflating mattress pad because you were too tired to close the valve…whatever. Just after you finally reach that sweet spot of falling asleep, your teammates come wake you to tell you its time to run. Ha. Ha.</p>

<p>It’s the middle of the night - and we’ve been running on empty for about 20 hours, we can’t find our runner that we need to meet. Of course we’re in the middle of the mountains and have nothing that resembles cell service, so we’re just wandering around trying to find our runner, only to find out that she’s already ready and waiting in the van. </p>

<p>The last leg of every runner’s set is always the hardest emotionally and maybe physically. There’s a moment when you’re running that last leg that you think “holy shit this is almost over…”, which is when these emotions come over you that you don’t expect. Things like “Wow - I just did this great thing with these amazing people.” or “Where the hell is the ‘one mile to go’ sign? I’ve been running for ages.” That’s when you look at your watch and you’re only .5 miles into a 10 mile leg. </p>

<p><img src="/images/articles/ragnar-cojo-sweat.jpg" alt="Sweaty Cojo" /></p>

<p>It’s literally blood, sweat, and tears out there on that last leg, maybe even some vomit. The runner before me on my last leg said, “sorry I was so slow - I had to puke into a bush”. Who apologizes for that!? Half way into my last leg of 10 miles uphill, I just sat down in the middle of the course and started crying. I was dehydrated, hungry, tired, and so very hot. August sun in the middle of the day in Colorado does not make for an ‘easy run’. </p>

<p>My teammates were there for me though. They helped me get up, hydrated, fed and told me to “stop crying about it and just run”. Then, a mile before the finish of my last leg - I see a teammate running towards me in the rain. Oh yeah, it started pouring ice cold rain right before I finished, I’m still unsure if it was a blessing or not.</p>

<p>She ran with me to the end cheering me on, telling me I could do it, when all I wanted to do was quit. </p>

<p>I couldn’t have done any of that without the team. </p>

<p>Embracing the crazy of everyone and the weekend, is what Ragnar is all about. You want to do this crazy hard thing, and these people cheer you on through the whole experience. They know you can’t do it without them, and they can’t do it without you. </p>

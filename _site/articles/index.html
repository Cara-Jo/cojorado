   <p class="excerpt">I’m really into crafts, this should not be a surprise to you. I do all sorts of things; photography, knitting, graphic design, and even small adventures in stained glass &amp; jewelry making. For a while, I was getting really exhausted with looking at my computer all day and then all night at home. So I decided to go totally analog with my crafting. Keith and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and I have...</p>

   <p class="excerpt">Remember that house we moved into in April? Since we’ve moved into it there are a few things we just couldn’t stand. One of those things was our side yard. The part of our yard that connects our front yard to our back yard. It came with this…‘adorable’ stone walkway. I think the only thing that was adorable about it was the gate you walked through to get to it. See, it’s pretty adorable. The...</p>

   <p class="excerpt">Keith and I just moved into a house. Together. Big steps people, big steps. We had been doing a ridiculous amount of commuting just to feed our addiction to each other. I would take the bus to Denver and spend the night at his place, and then he would come to Boulder in the morning and go to work. I’d spend weekends in Denver, and sometimes he would spend them in Boulder. After he stopped...</p>

   <p class="excerpt">I’m moving in with my amazing boyfriend in a few weeks. To celebrate this big step in our relationship I wanted to make some cute little illustrations that we could hang on the walls that represented where we have lived over the years. I was playing with some colors and text treatments and I sent a sample to a good friend of mine. She actually really loved it and wanted a set of prints for...</p>

   <p class="excerpt">This past weekend, I was fortunate enough to participate in the 40th annual Canyonlands Half Marathon in Moab, Utah. I ran this race last year, and it was my first time hanging out in Moab, so I couldn’t resist coming back for round two! The race has a beautiful course that takes you along the Colorado river for the first 10 miles on highway 128. Highway 128 is a beautiful scenic byway that follows the...</p>

   <p class="excerpt">Recently I accepted an offer from DataStax as Senior Designer on their Training Team. I will be working with a team of very talented people to make their current curriculum accessible to students, teachers and developers. It’s a huge undertaking and in the frist two weeks I’ve already learned tons of stuff! So what is DataStax? Directly from their website: DataStax powered by Apache Cassandra™ delivers a database platform purpose-built for the performance and availability...</p>

   <p class="excerpt">My favorite thing about running &amp; biking is the fact that I can shove as many tacos in my face as I want when I’m done. Seriously, I love tacos. When I’m running, all I can think about is tacos. Sometimes, I think about pizza, but mostly it’s tacos. I often wonder, “how many tacos can I eat when I get home?”. It has come to the point where I now need real-time data on...</p>

   <p class="excerpt">What has 12 arms, 12 legs, and 12 eyes? A dozen pirates. Or, one van full of Ragnar Runners! A Ragnar Relay is one of those things that you tell your mom you’re going to do and she either responds with “You’re crazy” or tries to join in. In my case, it was the latter, but there are a lot of people out there who think doing a 200 mile relay over 36 hours with...</p>

   <p class="excerpt">Girl Develop It is now in over 45 cities across the country. It’s pretty simple to see why; we offer affordable opportunities for women to learn software development. In nearly 5 years, Girl Develop It has grown to nearly 30,000 members across the country and empowers over 1,000 women a month. Why is Girl Develop It so important? Women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but hold just 25% of the jobs in technical...</p>

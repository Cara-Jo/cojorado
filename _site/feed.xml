  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week I had the amazing opportunity of speaking at Ignite Boulder 28. It was one of the best speaking experiences I have ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started out with a few drinks of beer at the annual Girl Develop It leadership retreat. Everyone was giving Ignite talks at the meet and greet happy hour. I was inspired and had consumed just enough liquid courage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I applied for Ignite Boulder 28. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/ignite-boulder1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignite talks are 5 minutes long and have 20 slides that advance every 15 seconds. The speaker doesn’t have control over the slides so they have to roll with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think I’d get accepted, but how could you not accept a talk about knitting, the weather and data. The choice was obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out I was speaking at Ignite Boulder on November 10th. The event was on December 10th, so I had just about 3 weeks to prepare my talk and get slides ready - AND memorize the entire thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t find out that I couldn’t bring notes up there until a week out. Which sent me into an immediate “what am I getting myself into” mode. I re-read all the emails and there was one small (seriously 8 point font) line in the congrats email that said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ps… You may not, for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reason, read your talk. Speak from the heart, nobody wants to hear a report. We have been relaxed on this rule in the past but I’m going to stand firm on this, if you bring a script onstage we will cut the mic and have a nice learning moment. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which to ME means that I can’t just read my slides…right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few little miscommunications like this throughout the event. One person said I get 1 comped ticket, another said 2, but only after I had already purchased a second ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an event organizer myself, things like that make me very very frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I powered through, got my slides to the right person on the right date and had surprisingly memorized my talk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a practice event a few nights before the event, and I was really happy for this. I had never given one of these talks, so it was nice to meet everyone before hand, have a beer, and freak out together. Getting candid feedback was really great and I was inspired by everyone’s talk! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night of the event I was surprisingly NOT nervous, at all. But once I walked up on stage to get an idea of the set up I just thought to myself  “Holy shit this is a big room”.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/ignite-boulder3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is held at the Boulder Theater, which can hold about 900 people. That’s a lot of faces staring back at you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was second after the intermission and had the glory of watching everyone go before me and watch them absolutely kill it on stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I did it, I got up on that stage and I talked about Knitting, the weather, data, and even made some funny jokes. The crowd seemed to really love my talk and in one case didn’t stop clapping and I missed an entire slide. But that’s okay because I couldn’t remember what I was supposed to say on that slide anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/ignite-boulder4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The after party was amazing and I am still humbled by the amazing community that is Ignite Boulder. They made me feel like a celebrity - even if it was only for 5 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch me talk for 5 minutes below:&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m really into crafts, this should not be a surprise to you. I do all sorts of things; photography, knitting, graphic design, and even small adventures in stained glass &amp;amp; jewelry making. For a while, I was getting really exhausted with looking at my computer all day and then all night at home. So I decided to go totally analog with my crafting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and I have this tradition of always making him something whenever it’s gift giving time.  I decided that I wanted to make him a book. Yeah, a book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I didn’t want to just go and design one online and then click some buttons and click order and have it show up on my doorstep one day. I wanted to really MAKE a book. I wanted to make the cover, the insides, the text, everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I had to decide what the topic of this book was going to be about. I could have written a book about pizza, cats, or biking. I didn’t really think he would find much romantic interest in that, so I decided to make it about our first year together. How fitting for a 1-year anniversary present. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-learn-calligraphy&quot;&gt;Step 1: Learn Calligraphy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, that’s easy - just go to the art store and get a thing of ink and one of those fancy pen things and go to town. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO. IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want this book to be some boring run-of-the-mill cojo-sans font. I wanted it to be beautiful and romantic, just like us. Obviously this meant I needed to learn Calligraphy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took to the Internet to try to find video tutorials online, but they were all boring and poorly filmed. Then I tried to find local workshops here in Denver. I found a few, but they were months ago, which did not help my cause. When I thought there was no end in sight, I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordshopdenver.com/&quot;&gt;Wordshop Paperie&lt;/a&gt;. They were hosting a Calligraphy class and I signed up as fast as I could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit expensive now that I think about it. It was only 2 hours and it cost $100. But I guess that paid for the 2 glasses of wine I had, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bookbinding-calligraphy1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Calligraphy: Day 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructor, Evette Goldstein, mentioned that she was having a 5-week Calligraphy class in Littleton in a few weeks. Guess how much that class cost? $99…you do the math at which is a better deal. But I signed up for it and went for 5 weeks and really learned a lot from her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went from making weird looking ‘G’s to making elegant flourishes! I became OBSESSED, like really obsessed. I think I spend probably 10 hours looking up Calligraphy and only spending maybe 5 hours a week actually doing it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class with Evette was really amazing and I’m so glad I decided to take it. I ended up meeting some amazing people in the class and then starting a Facebook group called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1630957933819468/&quot;&gt;Denver Calligraphers Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bookbinding-calligraphy2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Page 1 of the book. Left: final version. Right: rejected version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-do-embroidery&quot;&gt;Step 2: Do Embroidery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, because it’s me, I couldn’t have just a regular old printed book cover for this thing. IT HAD TO BE AWESOME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided the best way to do this was to make a custom embroidered cover…duh. I haven’t embroidered anything since I was a child and I was creating unicorns and rainbows. Just add that to the things I needed to re-learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out - I also love embroidery. It’s really easy to do on a plane or curled up with a kitten. After a bit of practice, I started the final iteration of the cover, which was an elaborate number 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bookbinding-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Design and progress of the cover&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bookbinding-cover-final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith was all “since when do you embroider”, to which my mom covered for me and said “since forever”. Phew. He was almost on to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also know, that I’m planning and building this book, all while living with the man that I’m making it for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-make-book&quot;&gt;Step 3: MAKE BOOK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need so many things to make a book! Cardboard thick enough (and not corrugated) for the cover, the cover art (my embroidery), decorative paper for the inside of the covers, waxed thread, an upholstery needle, a bone folder, an awl,  and paper for the pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to buy 90% of these things, which made explaining my &lt;em&gt;“oh shit I need to go to the craft store”&lt;/em&gt; excursions difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bookbinding-awl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pages of the book with holes punched and ready for stitching together - thanks to my new awl.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I gathered all the pieces, calligraphed the pages, and quadruple checked that everything was in order I was ready to build this thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a class on Skillshare on how to make a Coptic Stitch book. It’s a really pretty way of stitching the pages of the book together so that you can tell that the book was HAND MADE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out assembling a book, once you have all the tools, is really easy. Assembly only took about an hour - or however long it takes Keith to mow both the front and the back yards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bookbinding-coptic-bind.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Coptic Stitch on the bind almost looks like knitting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bookbinding-coptic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Coptic Stitch on the insides of the pages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bookbinding-covers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Insides of the covers, featured lots and lots of bikes!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-surprise-boyfriend&quot;&gt;Step 4: Surprise Boyfriend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the hardest part! I wanted to give it to him right when it was finished, but resisted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had planned a week-long trip to New York to celebrate our anniversary and to watch my best friend run the NYC Marathon. We made reservations at a fancy (but not TOO fancy) Italian restaurant. I am really proud of myself for waiting until after the appetizers to give him the gift. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/book-wrapped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, he was obviously surprised and in total awe that I made this thing for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to continue this trend every year :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bookbinding-tini.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Shout out to Tini for helping me with the book!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember that house we &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/that-one-time-i-moved-to-denver/&quot;&gt;moved into&lt;/a&gt; in April? Since we’ve moved into it there are a few things we just couldn’t stand. One of those things was our side yard. The part of our yard that connects our front yard to our back yard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came with this…‘adorable’ stone walkway. I think the only thing that was adorable about it was the gate you walked through to get to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-gate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;See, it’s pretty adorable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rocks of the path were just dropped down on some black weed fabric stuff, with nothing to hold them back from the rest of the yard. There was nothing in between them to keep them in place, so there were these huge gaps between them. Grass &amp;amp; weeds started to grow in between them so they started to get uneven and were really tricky to walk on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-start.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Weeds with a side of rocks?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith was heading to the mountains for a few days and I knew that he hated this path as much as I did. We are having a party this weekend and I didn’t want this mess to be the first thing our guests see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to rip it all up and re-do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the large rock slabs for the path - I think they are very ‘Colorado’, so I definitely wanted to keep those. I looked online for some inspiration on how to do what is called a Flagstone Walkway. I found a few tutorials and figured I could do it in 2 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Home Depot, purchased 7 bags of sand, 4 bags of river pebbles, 50x3 feet of weed fabric, 60 feet of shitty black edging, and a coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are renting this place, I wanted to do this on the cheap. Everything came out to about $70 including the coffee, which is not to shabby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-rip-all-the-things-out&quot;&gt;Step 1: Rip ALL the things out.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-weeds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;I had my work cut out for me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed to remove all the rocks, weeds, and old weed fabric from the area I was working in. The rocks were a non-issue, and surprisingly light. I feel like they are rocks made of air. There were some weeds in there though, that had some 1” round roots, which is insanity. It took me about an hour and a half to remove all the old stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only got about 1/2 done with this the first day. I went to Boulder that evening and came home to find that we got destroyed by an insane hail storm. In terms of ripping up the weeds though, it really helped because it killed all the weeds and made the ground nice and moist. The moist ground makes it SO much easier to pull weeds! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-mark-path-location&quot;&gt;Step 2: Mark Path location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-step2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make the path a little wider at our patio so that it looked a little more integrated. Before it was just a 3-foot wide path that joined that patio awkwardly. I found some sticks that worked well to mark the path. I walked back and forth on it a few times to make sure it felt right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I was satisfied, I took a straight shovel and dug into the dirt to mark where I was going to put the edging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you don’t know about our side yard is that there is a shit load of pipes under the dirt. Not deep either, a mere 2 inches under dirt… so I couldn’t dig very deep at all and had to be super careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-install-edging&quot;&gt;Step 3: Install edging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-step3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I couldn’t dig very deep with a large shovel, I had to do it by hand with a trowel. It took me a while, but it was better than accidentally hitting a pipe! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The edging sits a little higher out of the ground than I would have liked, but we have plans for the other side of the yard, but that’s for next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-level-the-ground-out&quot;&gt;Step 4: Level the ground out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-step4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to that hail/rain storm the ground was really moist so I was able to turn the dirt and rake it out to be a bit more level. Again having to be stupid careful because of those dang pipes. Seriously, who buries pipes only 2 inches deep?! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-5-lay-the-weed-block&quot;&gt;Step 5: Lay the weed block&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-step5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought some new weed block to put down. This stuff apparently prevents weeds from getting through and growing into your stuff. I don’t buy it one bit. BUT since I like to do things right, I put it down anyways. I was lazy and only put down one layer. The people before me had 3-4 layers and it clearly did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-6-sand&quot;&gt;Step 6: Sand!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-step6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I did not know, you’re supposed to put sand down between the weed block and whatever you’re laying down onto of it. Not sure why, but I’ll roll with it. I had JUST started to lay the sand down when BOOM, hail storm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s two hail storms in two days. I feared all my sand would wash away, but got lucky! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was running out of time and knew Keith was going to be home the next morning. After the hail storm, I went back out and finished the sand, despite the fact that I was basically making mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-7-put-the-path-stones-back&quot;&gt;Step 7: Put the path stones back.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-step7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had taken all these reference images on where the stones were before so that I had an idea of where to put them back. I looked at them and realized because of the weeds, there was no way to distinguish any sort of shape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an artist - so I decided to just make a new pattern! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out laying rocks down in a way that leaves enough room between them for pebbles and is easy to walk on is harder than it looks. Some of the rock slabs are quite thick, compared to the rest of them. I wanted to put them all in one spot - but it just didn’t make sense for them to fit there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-8-pebbles&quot;&gt;Step 8: Pebbles!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured pebbles would be the best thing to put in between the rocks to hold them in place. They would move with the rocks when you walked on them, and would look good with the rock slabs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the most fun part! It was like putting the finishing touches on a big project. I would just dump the rocks down and fill in the cracks with them, it was a really satisfying feeling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right before the sunset I finished up with the last of the pebbles. I knew I was going to need at least one more bag to fill in some of the bits I missed, but I was just too tired to deal with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-9-bask-in-the-glory&quot;&gt;Step 9: Bask in the glory!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/flagstone-bask.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so excited to show Keith I didn’t even let him put his stuff inside. He was really surprised and excited that I got it done before the party. It was even EXACTLY what he was thinking about doing himself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;watch-it-in-action&quot;&gt;Watch it in action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made a timelapse video of the entire process from start to finish. Keith and I just love timelapses so I thought this would be an awesome addition to a new path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set the camera up outside on the air conditioner, with a power cable going through the window. It looked a little wonky, but worked great! &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keith and I just moved into a house. &lt;strong&gt;Together&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big steps people, big steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been doing a ridiculous amount of commuting just to feed our addiction to each other. I would take the bus to Denver and spend the night at his place, and then he would come to Boulder in the morning and go to work. I’d spend weekends in Denver, and sometimes he would spend them in Boulder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he stopped working in Boulder, he would go days without going home. Then I got a remote job, and I would spend days away from home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our cats totally hated us. So we got them a house. Not just a cat house - but a people sized house to hold all their cat things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was relentless in searching for a house in Denver. People who say that buying a house is hard [in Denver] should try renting one. There’s no negotiating, or anything. I can’t really write the landlord a love letter or bake them cookies or outbid the other guy. I just have to be the first person with the best credit to apply. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/denver-craigslist.png&quot; alt=&quot;craigslist&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Look at all the housing in Denver!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every stupid morning I would load craigslist, Zillow, and countless other sites and browse the listings that somehow appeared while I was sleeping. I found this adorable house in Platt Park, an ‘up and coming’ neighbourhood in Southwest-ish Denver. No one really knows where Platt Park is, and I’m okay with that. It has all the benefits of living in Wash Park, but without the high prices and rich people problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short - we got the house. I screamed in excitement and nearly peed my pants when we found out we got it. Then it was “Oh shit, what did we just get into?”. Keith and I have only been dating not even 6 months. Plus, I hadn’t lived in a house since High School. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t think that renting a house is easier than owning a house. It’s pretty much the same, except when things break, I don’t pay for them. You have to do all these things, like call the appliance repair people, get your vents cleaned, get all your electrical outlets fixed, new lights in the garage, something with the basement, and carpet installed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t even account for the fact that the house is surrounded by a lawn. Seriously, do you know how needy lawns are? They need to be de-weeded, mowed, watered, edged and told a story every night before bed. The people before us were so absent in our lawn’s life, that there was a literal tree growing through the lawn mower. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/denver-keithweeds.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Keith and his weed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Look at Keith’s weed! (actual size)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house also came with two large raised garden beds, pre-filled with years of weeds, dog toys and remains of gardens past. We freed those dog toys and put to rest the gardens past and made ourselves a little vegetable garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/denver-gardenbeds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garden Beds&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re totally failing at being zucchini &amp;amp; tomato parents right now, we had to battle a lot of hail, but we’re making the best of it. Did you know cat carriers make excellent plant covers in a pinch? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/denver-keithgarden.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Keith Garden&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Look at our little babes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve just about finished painting the downstairs, finally covering up all instances of ‘humble gold’ that was throughout. We opted for a nice blue ‘Sausalito Sky’ color that makes the entire house feel fresh and airy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went and got ourselves an adult couch, had it custom made, and then delivered and assembled. Because that’s what you do when you’re an adult. You spend a shit load of money on furniture so you can freak out about every time the cat sits on it, wondering if this is the moment it gets’s clawed to pieces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/denver-couch.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Couch!&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yeah, it’s got a chaise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when you sit on your adult couch you look around thinking “wow, look at all this shitty living room furniture”, and go spend a shit load MORE money on tv stands, coffee tables, and sofa tables. Did you know that sofa tables are a thing? They’re not just called “the long skinny tables that go behind the couch”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all coming together, though. Only 1.5 months in and we are finally starting to make it feel like our own little space in this big city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living with Keith is pretty magical though, and I wouldn’t want to live with any other man. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cojorado.com/articles/2015/06/15/that-one-time-i-moved-to-denver.html&quot;&gt;That One Time I Moved to Denver&lt;/a&gt; was originally published by Cara Jo at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cojorado.com&quot;&gt;COJORADO&lt;/a&gt; on June 15, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m moving in with my amazing boyfriend in a few weeks. To celebrate this big step in our relationship I wanted to make some cute little illustrations that we could hang on the walls that represented where we have lived over the years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was playing with some colors and text treatments and I sent a sample to a good friend of mine. She actually really loved it and wanted a set of prints for herself. So, I made her 4 adorable little 5x5” prints for her apartment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/etsy-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith, the amazing boyfriend, mentioned maybe people would want to buy them on &lt;a href=&quot;http://etsy.com/shop/cojorado&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;. I felt like Etsy was already overly saturated with adorable prints of states. But then I started to look and I noticed that they were big, loud, and textured with some less than awesome Photoshop filters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured - for 20 cents I could post a few and if they don’t sell, I’m only out a few bucks. After posting a listing for Traverse City, Michigan, my hometown, someone bought it immediately! I was actually really surprised! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to add a few more states to the mix just to see what happens. Right now, I’ve only sold the one print - but who knows, maybe more people like clean/sharp/legible design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to branch out with some new design ideas, mostly focused on biking for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite print so far is from my “Love to Ride” series, that features a heart made out of bike chain links. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/etsy-lovetheride.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I’m focusing on making prints for specific states where biking is especially wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/etsy-ride-state.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see something you like on my shop, use the top secret code &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TEAMCOJO2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for a nice 20% off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you don’t see something you  want to buy - click the ‘Request Custom Order’ button and I’ll see what I can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;go-forth-and-buyhttpetsycomshopcojorado&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://etsy.com/shop/cojorado&quot;&gt;Go forth and buy!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, I was fortunate enough to participate in the 40th annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://moabhalfmarathon.com/&quot;&gt;Canyonlands Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt; in Moab, Utah. I ran this race last year, and it was my first time hanging out in Moab, so I couldn’t resist coming back for round two! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race has a beautiful course that takes you along the Colorado river for the first 10 miles on highway 128.  Highway 128 is a beautiful scenic byway that follows the canyon walls that were carved by the Colorado River. If you haven’t driven on this road - put it on your list now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struggling with my ability to actually start this race - let alone complete it. I have had a rough few months with my training. Between the two sinus infections, and bronchitis I somehow acquired adult asthma! It was getting to the point where I couldn’t even run 2 miles without heavy wheezing and coughing that made it impossible to continue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week before the race, the longest run I had done was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/246024274&quot;&gt;8 miles&lt;/a&gt; - and that was over a month prior. I was really concerned about my ability to finish this race. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite it all I figured I would give it a go. The worst that could happen was that I was too slow and would get picked up by the van &amp;amp; couldn’t finish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith and I got to Moab late on Thursday night, we wanted to spend all day Friday hiking and photographing. We went to Arches NP and spend a lot of time in Devil’s Garden. Devil’s Garden is located in the far North part of the park and features a 7.2 mile loop that includes a lot of arches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/moabtextures.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/cojokeithmoab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning was the half marathon, and I woke up a wee bit sore from the ridiculous 7 mile hike the day before. We had to get up early to catch the bus up the canyon at 7:30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this race is a point-to-point race, they have to bus all the runners up to the start, which is 13 miles up a windy canyon. All this bussing takes quite a bit of time and has to be complete before the 5 mile race starts at 9:30am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The half marathon doesn’t start until 10am, and you arrive at the staging area at around 8am. It’s cold, dark, and cold in that canyon early in the morning. The earlier you get up there is both a blessing and a curse. If you’re early enough - you can find a nice rock to sit on and keep warm on, but then you’re up there for ~1.5hr before the start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat on a rock next to a wonderful man, Bob, who has run this race 11 years in a row. Funny enough he grew up near Detroit and now lives in Denver. Such a small world! We people watched and chatted a bit about the other runners, and then went our separate ways towards the start line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first 5 or so miles of this race are downhill, and it feels great. By mile 1, you’re in the sunshine, and by mile 5 a lot of the runners who wore puffy vests and running tights were immediately regretting their decision. At mile 9, they have a real nice steep hill for you to meander up right before leaving the canyon and being thrust onto the highway into downtown Moab. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/canyonlands1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 3.5 miles of this race are just miserable. You’re running uphill, it’s hot, you’re tired, and you’re running on the side of a highway. BUT, the end is near! The last aid station always has a hose going and people handing out beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up finishing the race in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/272022189&quot;&gt;2:18:46&lt;/a&gt; which was about 15 minutes faster than I thought I was going to finish, and about 5 minutes faster than last years time! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/cojo-medal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith and I celebrated in usual post half marathon fashion, with a beer and a delicious lunch. We stuck around Moab for a few and took the scenic route out via the La Salle Loop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/lasal-loop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even opted for the long, more scenic, way back through Colorado as well. We wanted to check out Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP and weren’t disappointed! The canyon walls of that park are over 1/2 mile tall, it’s insanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an awesome trip with great company, perfect weather, and amazing scenery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be working with a team of very talented people to make their current curriculum accessible to students, teachers and developers. It’s a huge undertaking and in the frist two weeks I’ve already learned tons of stuff! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is DataStax? Directly from their website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataStax powered by Apache Cassandra™ delivers a database platform purpose-built for the performance and availability demands of IOT, Web, and Mobile applications. While relational databases fail under modern and dynamic workloads, high-volume data and new business requirements, Cassandra’s modern architecture makes it massively scalable, always available and easy to deploy. DataStax delivers a production version of Apache Cassandra, DataStax Enterprise (DSE), and the ecosystem to make the vision of Cassandra a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This position combines my love for design, teaching and developing, and I couldn’t be happier! &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about running &amp;amp; biking is the fact that I can shove as many tacos in my face as I want when I’m done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I love tacos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m running, all I can think about is tacos. Sometimes, I think about pizza, but mostly it’s tacos. I often wonder, “how many tacos can I eat when I get home?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has come to the point where I now need  real-time data on how many tacos I’ve earned during a run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wrote an app for my Suunto GPS watch, that tells me just that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/watch-tacos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tacos!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app could have been so easy - if only I had a heart rate monitor. Then, it’s really just calories burned = tacos you can eat. But I don’t have one of those. I had to dive deep into the scary world of math. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Math. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured I couldn’t be the ONLY person in the world that needed real-time tacos earned data. I figured I should probably write this app for all the people of the world, which presented a few challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;personal-data&quot;&gt;1. Personal data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of the Suunto platform, Movescount, can enter personal data about themselves. Things like age, weight, height, gender, etc. They can also opt out of those shenanigans and just be anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I need to grab their age and height. This info will come in handy for later calculations. If they don’t have any of that information, I assign them some default values of ‘average’ people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to find out if the user has a heart rate monitor, so they can pass go and collect 200 tacos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* If the user does not have an age - they are now 18 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_USER_AGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userAge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_USER_AGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userAge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* If the user does not have a height -  they are now 5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot; */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_USER_HEIGHT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_USER_HEIGHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;172&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* If the user has a HR monitor or not */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_HR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userKcal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_ENERGY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basal-metabolic-rate&quot;&gt;2. Basal Metabolic Rate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that everyone burns an average amount of calories per day that can be calculated based on their gender, age, height, and weight. In order to properly calculate how many tacos a person can earn on a run, I need to first find their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate&quot;&gt;BMR&lt;/a&gt; to use as a base number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a fun math equation for figuring that number out if you have all the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/bmr-equation.png&quot; alt=&quot;BMR equation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following code handles that based on information we can get from a user’s profile on Movescount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* CALCULATE BASAL METABOLIC RATE BASED ON GENDER */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* Dudes */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_USER_GENDER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_USER_WEIGHT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userWeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_USER_WEIGHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userWeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;defaultMaleWeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userBMR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;13.75&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userWeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;6.75&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* Laaadies */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_USER_WEIGHT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userWeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_USER_WEIGHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userWeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;defaultFemaleWeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userBMR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;9.46&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userWeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1.84&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;4.68&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;656&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;metabolic-equivalent&quot;&gt;3. Metabolic Equivalent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s this thing called a MET or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent&quot;&gt;metabolic equivalent&lt;/a&gt;. This is defined as the ratio of metabolic rate during a specific physical activity to a reference metabolic rate, set by convention to 3.5 ml O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I know is that there is a chart that assignes a MET to an activity, running is an 8 on the MET scale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* Activity Metabolic equivilent*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;activityMET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;duration&quot;&gt;4. Duration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this tacos earned business really comes down to how active you are for how long. Luckily, Suunto gives me that value in seconds. Unfortunately, my big equation needs it in hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I can do the math. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* Convert seconds to hours*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;activityDuration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_DURATION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-big-stupid-equation&quot;&gt;5. The big stupid equation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out how many calories a person burns while running, based on their age, height, weight and gender all you have to do is take their BMR divide it by 24 (to find how many calories they burn in an hour), multiply that number by the MET value and then multiply that number by activity duration. Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* Calculate Calories burned based on BMR &amp;amp; MET */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;calorieBurn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userBMR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;activityMET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;activityDuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* CALCULATE TACOS */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* 271 = calories in a Chipotle corn shell taco with black beans, brown rice, lettuce, &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;and cheese. */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SUUNTO_HR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tacosBurned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userKcal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;271&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tacosBurned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;calorieBurn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;271&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RESULT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tacosBurned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, so that’s how many calories a person burns on a run, but how many tacos have they earned? That is the burning question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the burning question is how many calories are in a taco? Well, that’s still up for debate, but let’s just say the average healthy runner would go to Chipotle and order a corn soft shell taco with chicken, brown rice, lettuce, and cheese. Because they’re healthy like that. They would then consume 271 calories per taco if they went that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tacos-earned&quot;&gt;6. ¡TACOS EARNED!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calories burned divided by calories in a taco (271) equals tacos earned! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can all be easily solved if the user has a heart rate monitor which just gives you calories burned based on heart rate. Which is probably a more accurate way to calculate things than letting a designer try to do math. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s all the code below for your consumption. You can download the app to your compatible Suunto watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movescount.com/apps/app10071393-Tacos_Earned&quot;&gt;over at Movescount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-has-12-arms-12-legs-and-12-eyes&quot;&gt;What has 12 arms, 12 legs, and 12 eyes?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-dozen-pirates&quot;&gt;A dozen pirates.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, one van full of Ragnar Runners! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Ragnar Relay is one of those things that you tell your mom you’re going to do and she either responds with “You’re crazy” or tries to join in. In my case, it was the latter, but there are a lot of people out there who think doing a 200 mile relay over 36 hours with 11 of your friends is…crazy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I think about it, Ragnar &lt;strong&gt;IS&lt;/strong&gt; crazy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crazy-fun&quot;&gt;Crazy fun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing; Ragnar is fun if you embrace the crazy. You have to go into it with a positive attitude and try not to let the little things get to you. Only then will you be able to experience the joy and achievement of running 200 miles as a team spread between two vans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 2014 Colorado race, I gathered a handful of my crazy runner co-workers and convinced a few friends to join in on this adventure from Copper Mountain to Aspen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you even get to run, there’s some things that need to be taken care of as a team. First - the team name. We had to come up with the best team name that represented the people on it. After many submissions to one of my many Google Forms, we settled on “Rolling Blackouts”. We landed on this because it’s a witty play on energy usage, and we have a custom beer in its namesake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention there’s the notebooks, gear lists, food lists, van logistics, and money.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/ragnar-van.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rolling Blackouts Van&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second - getting everyone in one spot at the same time for the pre-race dinner &amp;amp; van decorating. One of our team members has a cabin in Silverthorn, which is not far from the start. He let the team take it over for the night and we all made dinner together before giggling ourselves to sleep at something like 9pm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarms are set for 4:45am, so that Van 1 could get on the road to the start. Someone on our team’s has their alarm tone set to the theme song from the Lego Movie, so at 4:45am we all awoke to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“EVERYTHING IS AWESOME - EVERYTHING IS COOL WHEN YOU’RE PART OF A TEAM”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Not going to lie, it was a pretty hilarious start to the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van 1 gets rolling bright and early and heads to the start. Van 2 however…goes back to sleep. We’re not scheduled to start for another 7 hours, and plan to take full advantage of sleeping in a bed. It did give us time to head to the grocery store to grab some last minute snacks that Van 1 needed, and to get fixings for breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We meet Van 1 at Exchange 6 and start running legs 7-12. We won’t see Van 2 again for another 8 or so hours. They take advantage of the free time and go out to eat and sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piggybacking continues for the duration of the event until we finally all meet up at the finish line to cheer on runner 12 as she completes leg 36 into the finish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crazy-hard&quot;&gt;Crazy Hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people think that &lt;strong&gt;running&lt;/strong&gt; Ragnar is hard. I think it’s actually the parts where you’re &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; running that’s harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times you want to straight up kick people out of your van, or just want everyone to shut up so you can get 30 seconds of sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re sleeping on the floor of an elementary school gym thinking to yourself “Gosh it smells like shit in here, why am I doing this?”. Or the person next to you won’t stop snoring/farting/talking. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/ragnar-sleepingfloor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sleeping on the floor with style&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things you put into your stomach are ridiculous. I ate more random crap during the Relay then I do on a drunken Christmas treat binge. We had one member of our team bring home-made fried rice, and that was about the sanest thing I ate the whole trip. I mean I was sitting in the front of the van giving directions elbow deep into a bag of Cheetos. I didn’t even recognize myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/ragnar-friedrice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fried Rice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the running. The race is actually quite hard, Ragnar even says that it’s one of their hardest races in the series. The Colorado Relay is the highest in terms of elevation, and running that high in the sky is hard. Running and then stopping and then running again is harder than people think. Your leg muscles start to lock up after your 8 mile run when you’re crammed into a car chasing down your runner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crazy-exhausting--emotional&quot;&gt;Crazy exhausting &amp;amp; emotional&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re sleeping on the floor with your slowly deflating mattress pad because you were too tired to close the valve…whatever. Just after you finally reach that sweet spot of falling asleep, your teammates come wake you to tell you its time to run. Ha. Ha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the middle of the night - and we’ve been running on empty for about 20 hours, we can’t find our runner that we need to meet. Of course we’re in the middle of the mountains and have nothing that resembles cell service, so we’re just wandering around trying to find our runner, only to find out that she’s already ready and waiting in the van. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last leg of every runner’s set is always the hardest emotionally and maybe physically. There’s a moment when you’re running that last leg that you think “holy shit this is almost over…”, which is when these emotions come over you that you don’t expect. Things like “Wow - I just did this great thing with these amazing people.” or “Where the hell is the ‘one mile to go’ sign? I’ve been running for ages.” That’s when you look at your watch and you’re only .5 miles into a 10 mile leg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/ragnar-cojo-sweat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sweaty Cojo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s literally blood, sweat, and tears out there on that last leg, maybe even some vomit. The runner before me on my last leg said, “sorry I was so slow - I had to puke into a bush”. Who apologizes for that!? Half way into my last leg of 10 miles uphill, I just sat down in the middle of the course and started crying. I was dehydrated, hungry, tired, and so very hot. August sun in the middle of the day in Colorado does not make for an ‘easy run’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My teammates were there for me though. They helped me get up, hydrated, fed and told me to “stop crying about it and just run”. Then, a mile before the finish of my last leg - I see a teammate running towards me in the rain. Oh yeah, it started pouring ice cold rain right before I finished, I’m still unsure if it was a blessing or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She ran with me to the end cheering me on, telling me I could do it, when all I wanted to do was quit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t have done any of that without the team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracing the crazy of everyone and the weekend, is what Ragnar is all about. You want to do this crazy hard thing, and these people cheer you on through the whole experience. They know you can’t do it without them, and they can’t do it without you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/ragnar-kevin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kevin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m gathering 11 more friends this year to run Ragnar Colorado again. If you’re interested in joining the crazy, email me at hi@cojorado.com.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As the Lead Designer at Simple Energy, I’ve had a chance to design some really awesome things, for a great company. I’ve been there from what feels like the beginning, starting with the company when it was only 12 people strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve watched it grow into a large company of 50+ in less than two years, bringing in some great talent and ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Design isn’t all I do at Simple Energy. I am on the engineering team, so I’m immersed deep within the produciton of our amazing products. To get a great balance of design + code, I have the oportunity to step outside the user interface box. I get to help design the office space, the custom Simple Energy beer labels, the team member swag, annual holiday cards, and other goodies that make working there more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Below are a few of my favorite projects I’ve worked at while at Simple Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;logo-design&quot;&gt;Logo Design&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our old logo with Museo Sans and gradients everywhere was looking a little dates. I collaborated with a team of brand specialists to work on re-branding the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-04.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;business-cards&quot;&gt;Business Cards&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our brand is simple, clean, fun, and flat. When designing these business cards I wanted to bring all those elements into a 3.5” x 2” space. The leadership and sales teams all received horizontal cards, while the engineers and designers received vertical cards. But of course everyone had an option of what format they wanted! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-03.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;corporate-website&quot;&gt;Corporate Website&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our re-brand came a shiny new site to showcase our Engagement Platform and other products. In addition to showcasing our beautiful products, this site also reflects the great &lt;a href=&quot;http://simpleenergy.com/company/&quot;&gt;culture at Simple Energy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-08.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-09.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;holiday-cards&quot;&gt;2014 Holiday Cards&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep up with Simple Energy’s mission of motivating people to save energy, we decided to be a little witty with this year’s holiday cards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-02.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;beer-labels&quot;&gt;Beer Labels&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple Energy has a brewmaster on staff, he uses his skills to create custom beer for the company. The team votes on names for each new batch, then it’s labeled and bottled for everyone to take home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;core-values-icons&quot;&gt;Core Values Icons&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Simple Energy we have a set of Core Values that everyone is expected to uphold. To keep those Values front and center in the culture, we were tasked with designing icons to represent them that could be used throughout the office. I collaborated with another designer to create these five. Of course Do The Hard Things and Have Fun Together are my favorite, but I’m a bit biased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team members at Simple Energy are very active, and sometimes participate in crazy races together. As team captain of our company Ragnar Relay team the Rolling Blackouts, I got to design super custom race shirts. The team wore these throughout the weekend to represent the team and the company. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Girl Develop It is a non-profit that empowers women to learn software development. During the 3 years I’ve been with GDI I’ve had some time to design assets for the whole organization, of over 198 women leaders, to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;business-cards&quot;&gt;Business Cards&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are customized down to the chapter level.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-15.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;holiday-cards&quot;&gt;Holiday Cards&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a thank you to our sponsors and volunteers, chapters send out hand written Holiday Cards every year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-13.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;invitation&quot;&gt;Invitation&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chapters have launch parties and other large events that need more legit looking invitaions than MeetUp can provide.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-map&quot;&gt;Chapter Map&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another resource for chapters is having an accurate representation of the impact Girl Develop It is having across the country. This is used in posters, advertising, presentations and on the website.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-17.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-item&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;stickers&quot;&gt;Stickers&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often times chapters don’t have the resources to create their own stickers for their chapters or events. Templates are provided for them to allow them to do this.    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/design/design-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;image name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Girl Develop It is now in over &lt;a href=&quot;http://girldevelopit.com/chapters&quot;&gt;45 cities across the country&lt;/a&gt;. It’s pretty simple to see why; we offer affordable opportunities for women to learn software development. In nearly 5 years, Girl Develop It has grown to nearly 30,000 members across the country and empowers over 1,000 women a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/chapter-locations.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chapter Locations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is Girl Develop It so important? Women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but hold just 25% of the jobs in technical or computing fields. I personally don’t like those numbers, and I’m not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I started a local chapter here in Boulder, Colorado. I wanted to help diversify this heavily white male scene. Seriously it’s like every developer here is a white male, it’s actually impressive the lack of diversity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I landed in Boulder in early 2013 the first thing I did was explore the idea of starting a Girl Develop It out here. I had helped start one in Detroit and saw it’s success there and wanted to spread that across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;local-success&quot;&gt;Local Success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the one year and a half that Girl Develop It Boulder has been around we’ve achieved a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have grown to 880 members&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/boulder-party.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boulder 1 Year Birthday&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offered over 25 different &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of classes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/boulder-python.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Python&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve built up a community through our free social events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/code-cocktails.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Code &amp;amp; Cocktails&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boulder wasn’t enough - so we expanded to Denver and Fort Collins too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/articles/denver-class.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Denver&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the group grows, so do the needs of its members. We want to make sure that everyone has access to the tools they need to feel empowered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-classes&quot;&gt;New classes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our classes are designed to break down what can seem like a daunting topic - to it’s fundamentals. Classes are typically 8 hours and are taught over a weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, we want to offer some new classes like Python, Ruby, Android, iOs, Java, UX, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-workshops&quot;&gt;New Workshops&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workshops are a great opportunity for our members to get their hands dirty with a new topic without committing to the whole class. These topics are usually taught in 2-3 hours on a weekday. We want to offer a huge (seriously huge) range of new workshops this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to start we’re going to offer workshops like Sketch 3, Photoshop, Agile/Scrum, Behavioral Science, WordPress, FTP &amp;amp; GitHub Pages, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS, Sublime, Command Line, Docker and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;women-in-tech-panel-series&quot;&gt;Women in Tech panel series&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re putting together a 6 week Women in Tech panel series for the spring. We will be bringing together some of the most amazing Women in the Boulder/Denver tech scene to inspire our members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;more-community-events&quot;&gt;More community events&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Hour, Code &amp;amp; Coffee, Hack nights, and other social events really help our members connect with one another and create lasting relationships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;teacher-training&quot;&gt;Teacher Training&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming this year! GDI will offer teacher training so you get the skills you need to be a successful instructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-need-you&quot;&gt;We Need You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a woman to help. You don’t have to be a rockstar developer. You don’t have to jump right in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-are-many-ways-to-help&quot;&gt;There are many ways to help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;instruct&quot;&gt;Instruct&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-Teach or run solo, for a class and/or workshop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;teacher-assist&quot;&gt;Teacher Assist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer student questions and provide added insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;develop-curriculum&quot;&gt;Develop Curriculum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have something you want to teach, there’s probably people who want to learn it.
Review/enhance existing curriculum or create new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organizational-needs&quot;&gt;Organizational Needs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help out with marketing, social media, class scheduling, work with sponsors, answer student questions, &amp;amp; more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;provide-space&quot;&gt;Provide Space&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show off your awesome workspace by hosting a workshop, happy hour, or class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;donate-time&quot;&gt;Donate Time&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a crew of developers? Have your team TA or even teach a class for GDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;donate-resources&quot;&gt;Donate Resources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food, Drinks, Supplies, &amp;amp; swag all help make the learning experience better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-ideas&quot;&gt;Other Ideas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always open to ideas for classes, programming and overall improvements for this chapter. Please feel free to speak to one of our chapter leaders, or email us at boulder@girldevelopit.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill out the volunteer interest survey at &lt;a href=&quot;http://gdiboulder.com/support&quot;&gt;gdiboulder.com/support&lt;/a&gt; to get started with Girl Develop It Boulder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If donating money is more your thing, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://girldevelopit.com/donate&quot;&gt;donate to a chapter&lt;/a&gt; or the global organization.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;2014 was a great year for taking photographs. I went on a lot of adventures to Utah and other areas in Colorado I had never been before. My obsession with Moab started in March and is still going strong. Camping in the middle of the mountains also provided great inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In November I made the big switch to Nikon and purchased the D610 full frame camera. As pathetic as it is, this is the same time that I discovered HDR images. I tread lightly when creating HDR images because that edge glow can get a little crazy. With the help of Keith’s awesome collection of photography supplies I also discovered how amazing it can be to take panorama photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was in New York attending the 2014 Girl Develop It Leadership Summit. One of the chapter leaders that I was sitting next to was knitting a small project and we started talking about all the other awesome projects she was working on. She had briefly mentioned that she was also working on a ‘weather scarf’ and initially I thought “what else would you use a scarf in, besides the weather?”. She went on to explain that each row was it’s own color that was based on the average temperature for that day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought more about it and decided that would be a fun project to do for 2015. I generally fail at knitting throughout the year, and binge knit in the winter months. Knitting is a nice stress release for me and allows me time to unwind at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;many-questions&quot;&gt;Many Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few things I needed to get ready before I jumped into knitting 365 rows of colors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What yarn was I going to use?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would it have enough colors for me? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many degrees would each color represent? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What degrees will be in each color? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many yards of yarn will I need? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where will I get the weather data from? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What pattern will I use? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What size needles? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yarn&quot;&gt;Yarn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opted to go with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yarnspirations.com/vickie-howell-sheep-ish.html&quot;&gt;Bernat’s line of yarn called Sheep(ish)&lt;/a&gt; which you can get at Jo-Ann Fabrics. I’ve used it before, and it is nice and soft against the skin. I’m a strange cat and only like single ply yarn, it just creates such clean stitches. It’s also relatively inexpensive, at $3.99 a skein you can’t go wrong! It also comes in a large variety of colors, so I figured they would have enough colors for my temperature gauge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colors I went with, in order from ‘coldest’ to ‘hottest’:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raspberry(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plum(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navy(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teal(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turquoise(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chartreuse(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yellow(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coral(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Orange(ish) &lt;em&gt;Updated from Pumpkin(ish)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red(ish)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knitting/brioche-swatch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Swatch&quot; title=&quot;Color Swatch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with 10 colors because I had originally wanted to go from 0 to 100 degrees with each color representing 10 degrees. I changed how many degrees each color represented, but still stuck with the 10 colors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-issue-about-the-weather&quot;&gt;The issue about the weather&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought, I could just wing it, and figure out the weather on the fly. The more I thought about that, the more I decided that was a terrible idea. I wouldn’t know how much yarn to buy, and what colors and how many colors. I set out in search of yearly weather data to help a girl out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wunderground is my favorite weather source, for many reasons. My new favorite reason is the fact that they have an impressive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBDU/2014/1/1/MonthlyHistory.html#observations_details&quot;&gt;archive of weather data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the average temperature for each day I took the high and the low and found the average of those temperatures. I then popped the values into a spreadsheet and went to town. I filled a spreadsheet with 365 days of 2013’s weather data to set a baseline for future years. I picked 2013 because it has a full year’s worth of data, instead of 2014 which is still in progress. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knitting/brioche-fullspread.png&quot; alt=&quot;Brioche Spreadsheet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Keith’s spreadsheet wizardry, we wrote a pretty fantastic sheet to do all these calculations for us. First, we find the average high for the year, then the low. Then we take that number and divide it by 9. Why 9? Because it’s the number of colors minus 1… After we’ve divided the averages by 9 we have what we like to call the DEGREES OF SEPARATION. This is how many degrees represent each color. In this example our degrees of separation are 9, so each color represents 9 degrees of change. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knitting/brioche-degsep.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Math is hard, that is why Keith does it for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have how many degrees represent each color - we can then assign color values to each cell in the spreadsheet that gives us a good representation of what the scarf will look like. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knitting/brioche-allmonths.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pattern&quot;&gt;The pattern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I’ve struggled with making scarves because I find them boring and long. But then one day, I discovered the Brioche stitch, and my life has never been the same. The Brioche stitch is a magical stitch that makes all ribbing fluffy, enjoyable, and fast! I hate ribbing - but love how it’s reversible. A lot of people are intimidated by the Brioche stitch because it has an abundance of annoying acronyms. Let me tell you friends, it’s nothing but pure speed knitting satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;heres-the-super-easy-pattern&quot;&gt;Here’s the super easy pattern:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 1/1/2015: I have updated the edging to be more consistent and not bunch up on the sides.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CO 34 stitches with size 7 needles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wyf&lt;/strong&gt;: With yarn held in front as if to purl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up Row:&lt;/strong&gt; K2, *(wyf) slip 1, YO, K1; repeat from * to last two stitches, K1, S1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pattern Row:&lt;/strong&gt; K2 *(wyf) slip 1, K2TOG; repeat from * to last two stitches K1, S1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat Pattern Row twice for each day, this will create what appears as one row. Since the Brioche stitch is a special fluffy flower, two rows equal what appears to be one wide row. By doing two rows each day, all the yarn ends will stay on the same side of the scarf and you won’t run into that problem of having the yarn you need on the other side of the row. The two stitches on either side of the pattern are to create a clean edge up the scarf, optional if you’re not into that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;repeat&quot;&gt;Repeat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this work for 2015, I had to do a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up the base high and low. Remember above when I mentioned that the average high and low were calculated throughout the year? Well that’s cool - except if I’m giving the spreadsheet new data every day. Those numbers are going to change on the daily, and mess up my degrees of separation, which will in turn mess up the colors that represent each temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knitting/brioche-basedata.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that didn’t happen, I used the data from 2014 to set a base, and then took the ability for the spreadsheet to calculate away. I put in static numbers for the high and the low, which gave me 9 degrees of separation. Now when I enter new data every day in 2015, things won’t get recalculated and I won’t need to frog this scarf! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-can-do-it-too&quot;&gt;You can do it too!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made the spreadsheet &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pjsKu63y7HSVjkdF7K62ibfLJBV95QZR4Mbh4eoGtWc/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt; for this pattern, with all the work already done for you! All you need to do is enter in the highs and the lows for each day and it will calculate everything for you. Questions? Comment below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: anywhere you see a light blue cell is a cell you can edit. Well, you can edit any cell you want - but these special blue cells are the ones that are used for calulations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have provided two tabs for you to get started. Tab one is the previous year’s data. This will help you set up a baseline temperature to calculate the degrees of separation, as well as calculate the yardage you’ll need of each color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colors are conditional statements that you can change to match your color scheme.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knitting/brioche-conditional.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a proper yardage calculation enter in the yardage per skein. If you are going to use a different pattern you should knit at one row in the pattern and then measure how many inches that row uses of yarn. This number is what calculates the yards used. Inches per row divided by 36 = yards of yarn you need to buy.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knitting/brioche-yardage.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also provided you with some links to sample data from Wunderground. This is currently set to my location here in Boulder, CO. Feel free to update those to match your zip code! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to copy this to your Google Drive by going to &lt;em&gt;File &amp;gt; Make a Copy&lt;/em&gt;. This way you can edit it and you won’t lose any changes.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knitting/brioche-makecopy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact, my scarf will contain 24,820 stitches and enough yarn to span over 7 football fields! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers to 2015! &lt;/p&gt;
